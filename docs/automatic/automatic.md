# Automatic principle
Using the infra-red sensing, the automatic soap dispenser is fitted with a sensor, dispenser mechanism and a piston, where the sensor with a lens and pyroelectric tube can sense that the hand is in the position of the sensor, after sensing the signal, this signal is integrated and amplified to produce a switch signal to squeeze out the soap to the hand.
The automatic soap dispenser only dispenses liquid once, preventing waste.

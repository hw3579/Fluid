# Manual principle


The pump head uses the principle of pressurised suction, which means that the movement of the piston is used to expel the air present in the storage cylinder, creating a difference between internal and external air pressure, this allows the liquid to rise under air pressure and to be discharged from the outlet tube to the outside.
To prevent leakage during transport due to mutual squeezing, this pump head can only squeeze out liquid after the nozzle has been rotated, virtually eliminating leakage problems.
Easy to control the amount used per application.

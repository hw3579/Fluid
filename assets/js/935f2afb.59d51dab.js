It can be manually operated using a handle or can be automatic. Soap dispensers are often found in public toilets. After the outbreak of the covid, it can be seen more often in public place.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manual/manual":{"id":"manual/manual","title":"Manual principle","description":"The pump head uses the principle of pressurised suction, which means that the movement of the piston is used to expel the air present in the storage cylinder, creating a difference between internal and external air pressure, this allows the liquid to rise under air pressure and to be discharged from the outlet tube to the outside.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
